Ideas:

I am interested in learning is what the most common sources of income for each party. For example, do Republicans receive more money from the NRA than from other sources? What about for Democrats? After reading many of the attached articles, I have noticed a common theme: how are policies affected by organizations funding politicians? Iâ€™d be interested to see which organizations seem to have the biggest financial sway over the senate. Are there any organizations that fund both Democrats and Republicans?

Another idea is for former senators who have requested a filing extension, how many also requested an extension on their termination report? Does the frequency of senators who have requested a filing extension on their termination report go up if their number of past filing extensions is greater?
